# Changelog

All notable changes to **Aetherion** are documented in this file. This is the permanent record.

**Rule (standing, 2026-09-13):** every feature, command, persona change, voice change, or removal that lands on `main` is added here in the same commit or immediately after, with a calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do not skip the changelog. Do not leave new work only in commit messages.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Older packaged history stays under version headings. Aetherion work from September 2026 onward is grouped by date.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing waiting. New work is dated the day it ships._

## [2026-09-13]

### Added

- Exclusive multi-color **reaction roles** (Admin slash setup, anyone can react).
- Fair `/blackjack` against Aetherion (Hit / Stand / Double).
- Play-money **Aether Coins** saved in `data/ai_coins.json`.
- `/slots` — Cosmos Wheel, Nebula, Event Horizon. Bet 100–10,000. Same wallet as blackjack.
- `/leaderboard` and Ori-only `/givecoins`.
- Blackjack table art and Ori-only `/edit`.
- Blackjack **Play Again** + **Change Bet** after each hand (same last stake, no retyping `/blackjack`).
- `/cointoss` — Heads / Tails, 2% side landing at 2.5x, falling flip animation, custom Aether coin art. Bet 10–10,000.

### Changed

- `/slots` cabinet now animates (spark reel → blur → land) and uses a tighter Pocket / Winnings / Net embed.
- Play-money currency is now **Aether Coins** (was AI Coins).
- Blackjack table is a starfield with real suit glyphs.
- Aether Coin bets and grants go by **10s**. Blackjack minimum is 10.
- `/daily` grants **500** Aether Coins.
- Slot pair and trip multipliers are **2x** the previous table.
- `/cointoss` uses a smaller coin that falls the full frame. Odds are **48% heads / 48% tails / 2% side**.
- Coin toss background is a sharp starfield (no blur wash). Landing ring removed. Coin face is a minted plate with a pale **HEADS** / **TAILS** banner.
- Each slot machine has its own cabinet mark and reel glyphs: Cosmos 🪐, Nebula 🔮, Event Horizon 🕳️.

### Fixed

- Dealer blackjack no longer ends the hand on the deal.
- Reaction roles survive a Railway/Docker restart that wipes the save file.
- `/slots` cabinet thumbnail now draws a real PNG instead of a broken JPEG.

### Removed

- The short-lived ~2% kinder payout bump on slots and blackjack.
